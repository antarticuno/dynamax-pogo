# dynamax-pogo
This is a website for displaying dynamax/gigantamax battle information. The Dynamax mechanic was added to Pokemon GO in the fall of 2024 and has become a polarizing feature due to its difficulty, required cooperation, and strategy. As a community leader in my local area, I wanted to build a tool that could help explain and clarify this mechanic for players in the hopes that it would encourage people to try out these battles more.

## Running Instructions
